A slider provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content.

Use a slider when you want people to set defined values (such as volume or brightness), or when people would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.

        Text("Default slider:"),
        Slider(),
        Text("Default disabled slider:"),
        Slider(disabled=True))

flet.app(target=main)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Sliders with values

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
import flet
from flet import Slider, Text

def main(page):
    page.add(
        Text("Slider with value:"),
        Slider(value=0.3),
        Text("Slider with a custom range and label:"),

import flet
from flet import Slider, Text

    def slider_changed(e):

        page.update()

    t = Text()
    page.add(

        Slider(min=0, max=100, divisions=10, label="{value}%", on_change=slider_changed), t)

## Properties

### `value`

The currently selected value for this slider.

The slider's thumb is drawn at a position that corresponds to this value.

### `min`

The minimum value the user can select.

Defaults to `0.0`. Must be less than or equal to `max`.

If the `max` is equal to the `min`, then the slider is disabled.

### `max`

The maximum value the user can select.

Defaults to `1.0`. Must be greater than or equal to `min`.

If the `max` is equal to the `min`, then the slider is disabled.

### `divisions`

The number of discrete divisions.

Typically used with `label` to show the current discrete value.

If not set, the slider is continuous.

### `label`

Format with `{value}`.

A label to show above the slider when the slider is active. The value of `label` must contain `{value}` which will be replaced with a current slider value.

It is used to display the value of a discrete slider, and it is displayed as part of the value indicator shape.

If not set, then the value indicator will not be displayed.

### `autofocus`

True if the control will be selected as the initial focus. If there is more than one control on a page with autofocus set, then the first one added to the page will get focus.

## Events

### `on_change`

Fires when the state of the Slider is changed.

### `on_focus`

Fires when the control has received focus.

### `on_blur`

Fires when the control has lost focus.
