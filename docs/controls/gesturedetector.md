---

A control that detects gestures.

Attempts to recognize gestures that correspond to its non-null callbacks.

If this control has a `content`, it defers to that child control for its sizing behavior. If it does not have a `content`, it grows to fit the parent instead.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Examples

### Draggable containers

The following example demonstrates how a control can be freely dragged inside a Stack.

The sample also shows that GestureDetector can have a child control (blue container) as well as be nested inside another control (yellow container) giving the same results.

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    def on_pan_update1(e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):
        c.top = max(0, c.top + e.delta_y)
        c.left = max(0, c.left + e.delta_x)
        c.update()

## Properties

### `content`

A child Control contained by the gesture detector.

### `mouse_cursor`

The mouse cursor for mouse pointers that are hovering over the control. Possible values of `MouseCursor` enum:

* `ALIAS`
* `ALL_SCROLL`
* `BASIC`
* `CELL`
* `CLICK`
* `CONTEXT_MENU`
* `COPY`
* `DISAPPEARING`
* `FORBIDDEN`
* `GRAB`
* `GRABBING`
* `HELP`
* `MOVE`
* `NO_DROP`
* `NONE`
* `PRECISE`
* `PROGRESS`
* `RESIZE_COLUMN`
* `RESIZE_DOWN`
* `RESIZE_DOWN_LEFT`
* `RESIZE_DOWN_RIGHT`
* `RESIZE_LEFT`
* `RESIZE_LEFT_RIGHT`
* `RESIZE_RIGHT`
* `RESIZE_ROW`
* `RESIZE_UP`
* `RESIZE_UP_DOWN`
* `RESIZE_UP_LEFT`
* `RESIZE_UP_LEFT_DOWN_RIGHT`
* `RESIZE_UP_RIGHT`
* `RESIZE_UP_RIGHT_DOWN_LEFT`
* `TEXT`
* `VERTICAL_TEXT`
* `WAIT`

### `drag_interval`

Throttling in milliseconds for horizontal drag, vertical drag and pan update events. When a user moves a pointer a lot of events are being generated to do precise tracking. `drag_interval` allows sending drag update events to a Flet program every X milliseconds, thus preserving the bandwidth (web and mobile apps). Default is `0` - no throttling, all events are sent to a Flet program, very smooth tracking.

### `hover_interval`

Throttling in milliseconds for `on_hover` event.
