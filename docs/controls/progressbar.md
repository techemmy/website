A material design linear progress indicator, also known as a progress bar.

A control that shows progress along a line.

There are two kinds of linear progress indicators:

* *Determinate*. Determinate progress indicators have a specific value at each point in time, and the value should increase monotonically from `0.0` to `1.0`, at which time the indicator is complete. To create a determinate progress indicator, use a non-null value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
* *Indeterminate*. Indeterminate progress indicators do not have a specific value at each point in time and instead indicate that progress is being made without indicating how much progress remains. To create an indeterminate progress indicator, use a null value.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Examples

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
from time import sleep

import flet
from flet import Column, Page, ProgressBar, Text

def main(page: Page):
    pb = ProgressBar(width=400)

    page.add(
        Text("Linear progress indicator", style="headlineSmall"),
        Column([Text("Doing something..."), pb]),
        Text("Indeterminate progress bar", style="headlineSmall"),
        ProgressBar(width=400, color="amber", bgcolor="#eeeeee"),
    )

    for i in range(0, 101):
        pb.value = i * 0.01
        sleep(0.1)
        page.update()

flet.app(target=main)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Properties

### `value`

The value of this progress indicator. A value of 0.0 means no progress and 1.0 means that progress is complete. The value will be clamped to be in the range 0.0-1.0. If null, this progress indicator is indeterminate, which means the indicator displays a predetermined animation that does not indicate how much actual progress is being made.

### `bar_height`

The minimum height of the line used to draw the linear indicator. Default is 4.

### `color`

The progress indicator's color.

### `bgcolor`

Color of the track being filled by the linear indicator.

### `tooltip`

The text displayed when hovering the mouse over the control.
