description: Learn how to build Flet apps in Python.
sidebar_label: Getting started
---

To write a Flet app you don't need to be front-end guru, but it's recommended to have a basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming.

In this guide we'll study the structure of a Flet app, learn how to output data using Flet controls, request data from a user and build basic page layouts. We will also cover some packaging and deployment options to deliver a ready app to your users.

## Installing `flet` module

Flet requires Python 3.7 or above. To start with Flet, you need to install `flet` module first:

```bash
pip install flet
```

:::note
To upgrade `flet` module run:

```bash
pip install flet --upgrade
```
:::

To install Flet pre-release (for advanced users) run:

```bash
pip install flet --pre
```

:::caution
We recommend installing pre-release builds into a virtual environment.

### Linux

Running Flet apps on Linux and WSL requires [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) libraries installed. Most probably you already have them in your system, but if you are getting `error while loading shared libraries: libgstapp-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` while running Flet app then you need to install GStreamer.

To install GStreamer on Ubuntu/Debian run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-doc gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio
```

See [this guide](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html?gi-language=c) for installing on other Linux distributives.

### WSL

Flet apps can be run on WSL2. If you are getting `cannot open display` error [following this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/wiki/Diagnosing-%22cannot-open-display%22-type-issues-with-WSLg) for troubleshooting.

## Basic app structure

A very minimal Flet app has the following structure:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    # add/update controls on Page
    pass

ft.app(target=main)
```
<img src="/img/docs/getting-started/basic-app-structure.png" className="screenshot-50" />

:::note
This section is intentionally called "basic" as later in this guide we'll look at more real-world approaches to app structure with reusable controls.
:::

A typical Flet program ends with a call to `flet.app()` where the app starts waiting for new user sessions. Function `main()` is an entry point in a Flet application. It's being called on a new thread for every user session with a `Page` instance passed into it. When running Flet app in the browser a new user session is started for every opened tab or page. When running as a desktop app there is only one session created.

`Page` is like a "canvas" specific to a user, a visual state of a user session. To build an application UI you add and remove controls to a page, update their properties. Code sample above will be displaying just a blank page to every user.

By default, Flet app starts in a native OS window, which is very handy for developing. However, you can open it in a new browser window by modifying a call to `flet.app` as following:

```python
ft.app(target=main, view=ft.WEB_BROWSER)
```

:::info
Internally, every Flet app is a web app and even if it's opened in a native OS window a built-in web server is still started on a background. Flet web server is called "Fletd" and by default it's listening on a random TCP port. You can specify a custom TCP port and then open the app in the browser along with desktop view:

```python
flet.app(port=8550, target=main)
```

Open `http://localhost:<port>` in your browser to see web version of your Flet app.

## Controls

User interface is made of **Controls** (aka widgets). To make controls visible to a user they must be added to a `Page` or inside other controls. Page is the top-most control. Nesting controls into each other could be represented as a tree with Page as a root.

Controls are just regular Python classes. Create control instances via constructors with parameters matching their properties, for example:

```python
t = ft.Text(value="Hello, world!", color="green")
```

To display control on a page add it to `controls` list of a Page and call `page.update()` to send page changes to a browser or desktop client:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    t = ft.Text(value="Hello, world!", color="green")
    page.controls.append(t)
    page.update()

ft.app(target=main)
```
<img src="/img/docs/getting-started/controls-text.png" className="screenshot-50" />

:::note
In the following examples we will be showing just the contents of `main` function.
:::

You can modify control properties and the UI will be updated on the next `page.update()`:

```python
t = ft.Text()
page.add(t) # it's a shortcut for page.controls.append(t) and then page.update()

for i in range(10):
    t.value = f"Step {i}"
    page.update()
    sleep(1)
```

Some controls are "container" controls (like Page) which could contain other controls. For example, `Row` control allows arranging other controls in a row one-by-one:

```python
page.add(
    ft.Row(controls=[
        ft.Text("A"),
        ft.Text("B"),
        ft.Text("C")
    ])
)
```

or `TextField` and `ElevatedButton` next to it:

```python
page.add(
    ft.Row(controls=[
        ft.TextField(label="Your name"),
        ft.ElevatedButton(text="Say my name!")
    ])
)
```

`page.update()` is smart enough to send only the changes made since its last call, so you can add a couple of new controls to the page, remove some of them, change other controls' properties and then call `page.update()` to do a batched update, for example:

```python
for i in range(10):
    page.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Line {i}"))
    if i > 4:
        page.controls.pop(0)
    page.update()
    sleep(0.3)
```

Some controls, like buttons, could have event handlers reacting on a user input, for example `ElevatedButton.on_click`:

```python
def button_clicked(e):
    page.add(ft.Text("Clicked!"))

page.add(ft.ElevatedButton(text="Click me", on_click=button_clicked))
```

and more advanced example for a simple To-Do:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page):
    def add_clicked(e):
        page.add(ft.Checkbox(label=new_task.value))

    new_task = ft.TextField(hint_text="Whats needs to be done?", width=300)
    page.add(ft.Row([new_task, ft.ElevatedButton("Add", on_click=add_clicked)]))

ft.app(target=main)
```

:::info
Flet implements *imperative* UI model where you "manually" build application UI with stateful controls and then mutate it by updating control properties. Flutter implements *declarative* model where UI is automatically re-built on application data changes.
Managing application state in modern frontend applications is inherently complex task and Flet's "old-school" approach could be more attractive to programmers without frontend experience.
:::

### `visible` property

Every control has `visible` property which is `true` by default - control is rendered on the page. Setting `visible` to `false` completely prevents control (and all its children if any) from rendering on a page canvas. Hidden controls cannot be focused or selected with a keyboard or mouse and they do not emit any events.

### `disabled` property

Every control has `disabled` property which is `false` by default - control and all its children are enabled.
`disabled` property is mostly used with data entry controls like `TextField`, `Dropdown`, `Checkbox`, buttons.
However, `disabled` could be set to a parent control and its value will be propagated down to all children recursively.

For example, if you have a form with multiple entry control you can set `disabled` property for each control individually:

```python
first_name = ft.TextField()
last_name = ft.TextField()
first_name.disabled = True
last_name.disabled = True
page.add(first_name, last_name)
```

or you can put form controls into container, e.g. `Column` and then set `disabled` for the column:

```python
first_name = ft.TextField()
last_name = ft.TextField()
c = ft.Column(controls=[
    first_name,
    last_name
])
c.disabled = True
page.add(c)
```

## Control Refs

Flet controls are objects and to access their properties we need to keep references (variables) to those objects.

Consider the following example:

```python {6-8,18,19,21}
import flet as ft

def main(page):

    first_name = ft.TextField(label="First name", autofocus=True)
    last_name = ft.TextField(label="Last name")
    greetings = ft.Column()

    def btn_click(e):
        greetings.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Hello, {first_name.value} {last_name.value}!"))
        first_name.value = ""
        last_name.value = ""
        page.update()
        first_name.focus()

    page.add(
        first_name,
        last_name,
        ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=btn_click),
        greetings,
    )

ft.app(target=main)
```
<img src="/img/docs/getting-started/control-refs.png" className="screenshot-50" />


In the very beginning of `main()` method we create three controls which we are going to use in button's `on_click` handler: two `TextField` for first and last names and a `Column` - container for greeting messages. We create controls with all their properties set and in the end of `main()` method, in `page.add()` call, we use their references (variables).

When more and more controls and event handlers are added it becomes challenging to keep all control definitions in one place, so they become scattered across `main()` body. Glancing at `page.add()` parameters it's hard to imagine (without constant jumping to variable definitions in IDE) what would the end form look like:

```python {2-5}
    page.add(
        first_name,
        last_name,
        ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=btn_click),
        greetings,
    )
```

Is `first_name` a TextField, does it have autofocus set? Is greetings a `Row` or a `Column`?

Flet provides `Ref` utility class which allows to define a reference to the control, use that reference in event handlers and set the reference to a real control later, while building a tree. The idea comes from [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html).

To define a new typed control reference:

```python
first_name = ft.Ref[ft.TextField]()
```

To access referenced control (control de-reference) use `Ref.current` property:

```python
# empty first name
first_name.current.value = ""
```

To assign control to a reference, set `Control.ref` property to a reference:

```python {2}
page.add(
    ft.TextField(ref=first_name, label="First name", autofocus=True)
)
```

:::note
All Flet controls have `ref` property.
:::

We could re-write our program to use references:

```python {7-9,21-24}
import flet as ft


def main(page):

    first_name = ft.Ref[ft.TextField]()
    last_name = ft.Ref[ft.TextField]()
    greetings = ft.Ref[ft.Column]()

    def btn_click(e):
        greetings.current.controls.append(
            ft.Text(f"Hello, {first_name.current.value} {last_name.current.value}!")
        )
        first_name.current.value = ""
        last_name.current.value = ""
        page.update()
        first_name.current.focus()

    page.add(
        ft.TextField(ref=first_name, label="First name", autofocus=True),
        ft.TextField(ref=last_name, label="Last name"),
        ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=btn_click),
        ft.Column(ref=greetings),
    )

ft.app(target=main)
```
<img src="/img/docs/getting-started/control-refs-rewritten.png" className="screenshot-50" />

Now we can clearly see in `page.add()` the structure of the page and all the controls it's built of.

Yes, the logic becomes a little bit more verbose as you need to add `.current.` to access ref's control, but it's a matter of personal preference :)
